This little python script use stockfish to calculate best moves from a game.

For the first release, the player won 1 point if it's the stockfish best move.

At the end the average is calculated on the number of moves played by the player. Ex: 30 shots played with the 15 best stockfish shots = 15/30 = 50% accuracy
